These tutorials and their content were developed with the help (both directly and indirectly) of all these people.
Here I include the respective acknowledgements and also links to the websites that can be useful to learn more of scientific data visualization in blender.


Download Blender from:						www.blender.org
To install python and numpy go to:				http://www.scipy.org/install.html
To download the Protoplanetary Disk Simulation code go to:	http://fargo.in2p3.fr/


Other scientists which have done scientific visualization using Blender are:

Special thanks to:
Dr. Jorge Cuadra from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, who developed the Stellar Winds simulations made with Gadget-2 in Geryon*.
Dr. Sebastián Perez from Universidad de Chile, who developed the Protoplanetary Disk simulation with Fargo3D in Belka**.
Dr. Pablo-Benitez Llambay (main developer of Fargo3D) Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, who collaborated in the development of the bvoxer_Fargo3D code.

*The Geryon/Geryon2 cluster housed at the Centro de Astro-Ingenieria UC was used for (part) the calculations performed in this work. The BASAL PFB-06 CATA, Anillo ACT-86, FONDEQUIP AIC-57, and QUIMAL 130008 provided funding for several improvements to the Geryon/Geryon2 cluster.
**These simulations were performed in the Belka GPU cluster by S. Perez at the Protoplanetary Diisk Millennium Nucleus, commissioned thanks to a FONDEQUIP grant."
