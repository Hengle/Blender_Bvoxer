# Blender_Bvoxer
Codes and blendfiles to use voxel data for scientific visualization in blender.

In this repository are all the files used in the tutorial series: "Blender and Astronomy Tutorial. Using Voxels for 3D visualization".  
The first video tutorial: "Understanding Blender Voxel Data", uses the folder called "Example".  
The second video tutorial: "Basics of Blender for scientists", uses the folder "Basics".  
The third video tutorial: "Working with Astronomical data ub Blender", uses the folders "SPH" and "GridArray"  
The fourth video tutorial: "Voxel Animation and Fargo3D Voxelizer", used the folder "VoxelAnimation" and "Fargo3D_VoxelizerCode".

We include a PDF with the acknowledgements to all the people that one way or another contributed to develope these video tutorials.  
Specially to the scientists that shared their data present in this repository, and also the ones that have developed tutorials about the use of blender for scientific visualization.
